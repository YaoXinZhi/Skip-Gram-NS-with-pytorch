# Skip-Gram-NS-with-pytorch
pytorch implements basic skip-gram algorithm and skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling.\\

pytorch's simple skip-gram algorithm, in order to facilitate understanding, the code format is completely installed in the data processing process. If you want to run the code, you only need to prepare the input file in the same format and modify the file path in the code. If you have any questions, please contact me.
