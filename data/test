cloning of a cdna encoding an importin-alpha and down-regulation of the gene by light in rice leaves	nbr	gene	central research institute of electric power industry chiba japan 	the import of nuclear proteins into nuclei begins with recognition of nuclear localization signal-harboring proteins and binding to a nuclear pore targeting complex a cdna for an importin-alpha protein a subunit of the complex was isolated from rice plants the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cdna exhibited a high homology to those of importin-alpha proteins from many organisms such as arabidopsis thaliana saccharomyces cerevisiae human mouse xenopus laevis and drosophila melanogaster down-regulation of the transcription by light was shown in the leaves of light- and dark-grown seedlings by rna blot analysis the down-regulation was specific to leaves whereas no light effect was observed in root tissues or calli in which higher levels of the transcript were detected 	alphanbra
